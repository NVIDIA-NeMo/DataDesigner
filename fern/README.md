# Fern Docs

This folder is the Fern Docs build for NeMo Data Designer. The site currently deploys to **`datadesigner.docs.buildwithfern.com/nemo/datadesigner`**; [`docs.yml`](docs.yml) also declares the future `docs.nvidia.com/nemo/datadesigner` custom domain.

## Migration phase

Data Designer is moving from MkDocs to Fern over several releases. During that transition:

- Keep the MkDocs build and release archive working.
- Keep Fern working in parallel for local checks and hosted validation.
- Treat `docs/` as the docs source of truth unless a page has already been intentionally moved to Fern-only MDX.
- Treat `docs/notebook_source/*.py` as the notebook source of truth.
- Keep generated Fern API reference and notebook artifacts gitignored.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Fern CLI globally
npm install -g fern-api
```

## First-time setup

Two pre-render steps are needed before the dev server has all content. Both produce gitignored files and are safe to rerun.

### 1. Python API reference (gitignored - must regenerate)

`make generate-fern-api-reference` uses `py2fern` to extract API docs from the local Python source (`packages/data-designer-config/src/data_designer/config`). The output lands in `fern/code-reference/data-designer/` (gitignored).

```bash
make generate-fern-api-reference
```

The `libraries:` block in [`docs.yml`](docs.yml) still documents the equivalent Fern-native generator. Run `make generate-fern-api-reference-native` only when you want the Fern CLI output and have Fern auth.

Re-run when the upstream package source changes.

### 2. Notebook tutorials (gitignored - regenerate on clone)

Each tutorial source file is converted to a JSON+TS pair in `fern/components/notebooks/`, then rendered through the `<NotebookViewer>` component on the wrapper MDX page. Output is gitignored; regenerate it after cloning and after changing `docs/notebook_source/*.py`.

```bash
make generate-fern-notebooks                 # convert docs/notebook_source/*.py, preferring docs/notebooks/*.ipynb when present
make generate-fern-notebooks-with-outputs    # full pipeline: execute → colabify → convert (needs NVIDIA_API_KEY)
```

The docs build does not use `docs/colab_notebooks/`; those files exist for the wrapper pages' `colabUrl` links. The converter (`fern/scripts/ipynb-to-fern-json.py`) still strips Colab-only setup cells defensively if run on a Colab notebook.

Fern does not run this conversion automatically. Run `make prepare-fern-docs` before local preview/checks, and run the same notebook conversion in CI before `fern generate --docs`.

## Local preview

```bash
make serve-fern-docs-locally
# → http://localhost:3000
```

`serve-fern-docs-locally` generates Fern API reference and notebook artifacts before starting `fern docs dev`. It does not publish.

## CI and publishing

Fern publishing runs alongside MkDocs during migration:

- `.github/workflows/build-fern-docs.yml` runs on release publication or manual dispatch. It builds executed notebooks, runs `make check-fern-docs`, and publishes Fern.
- `.github/workflows/publish-fern-devnotes.yml` runs on `main` when Dev Notes or Fern Dev Notes assets change, plus manual dispatch. It reuses the last docs notebook artifact, runs `make check-fern-docs`, and publishes Fern.
- `.github/workflows/docs-preview.yml` remains the PR preview workflow and posts both MkDocs and Fern preview links for same-repository PRs. It converts tutorial sources without execution outputs for preview builds. Fork PRs still run docs build/checks, but skip hosted previews because those require deployment secrets.

These workflows require the org-level `DOCS_FERN_TOKEN` secret. The workflows expose it to the Fern CLI as `FERN_TOKEN`.

Release publishing also runs `fern/scripts/fern-release-version.py check` before building notebooks. A release fails early if the release tag is not represented in `docs.yml` and `versions/vX.Y.Z.yml`, or if `latest.yml` does not match the release nav on the release event. Manual dispatch can validate a specific tag through the workflow's `release_tag` input; otherwise it uses the latest published release.

## Versioning

Current Fern versions:

```
fern/versions/
├── latest.yml          ← rolling nav file
├── latest/pages/...    ← optional latest-only page overrides after release divergence
├── v0.6.0.yml          ← release nav file
├── v0.6.0/pages/...    ← v0.6.0-only page overrides
├── v0.5.9.yml          ← release nav file
├── v0.5.9/pages/...    ← v0.5.9-only page overrides
├── v0.5.8.yml          ← first migrated release nav file
├── v0.5.8/pages/...    ← shared migrated MDX tree
├── older.yml           ← older versions landing page
└── older/pages/...     ← links to the MkDocs archive
```

`docs.yml` registers `slug: latest`, `slug: v0.6.0`, `slug: v0.5.9`, `slug: v0.5.8`, and `slug: older-versions`. The `latest`, `v0.6.0`, and `v0.5.9` nav files intentionally reuse older version page trees for unchanged content so Fern-native versions do not duplicate every page. Add version-specific page copies only when content diverges.

Fern version URLs are based on the active version entry, not the source file path. A `v0.5.9` page can point at `./v0.5.8/pages/...` and still render under `/nemo/datadesigner/v0.5.9/...`; users do not see the reused source path.

Before editing a file under an older shared tree such as `fern/versions/v0.5.8/pages/...`, check every `fern/versions/*.yml` file that points at it. If the content describes a newer release, copy it into the target `vX.Y.Z/pages/...` tree and retarget that release. Point `latest.yml` at the released copy unless latest has already diverged after that release.

Dev Notes are versioned: `latest.yml` can include posts from `main` that are not in old release navs yet. Frozen release navs (`v0.6.0.yml`, `v0.5.9.yml`, `v0.5.8.yml`) should include only posts available at that release point. If a Dev Note says "As of Data Designer vX.Y.Z", do not add it to an older frozen nav or an older shared page tree.

Released versions older than `v0.5.8` stay on the MkDocs archive at `https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/DataDesigner/<version>/`. The Fern version picker includes an "Older versions" page linking to those archives.

When cutting future Fern-native versions, use a hybrid model:

1. Run `make prepare-fern-release VERSION=X.Y.Z`.
2. Review the generated `docs.yml` and `versions/vX.Y.Z.yml` changes.
3. Reuse older page paths for unchanged content.
4. Copy changed/new pages into `versions/vX.Y.Z/pages/...`.
5. Point only changed nav entries at the copied `vX.Y.Z` pages.
6. Point `latest.yml` at the new release copy. Use `latest/pages/...` only for post-release divergence.
7. Run `make check-fern-docs`.

Do not add a new version entry without deciding which pages are release-specific. A version YAML that points at shared pages can drift when those shared files change later.
