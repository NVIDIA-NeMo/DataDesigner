title: Use Case Recipes
description: Ready-to-use code examples for common Data Designer use cases.
---

Recipes are a collection of code examples that demonstrate how to leverage Data Designer in specific use cases.
Each recipe is a self-contained example that can be run independently.

<Info title="New to Data Designer?">
Recipes provide working code for specific use cases without detailed explanations. If you're learning Data Designer for the first time, we recommend starting with our [tutorial notebooks](/docs/tutorials/overview), which offer step-by-step guidance and explain core concepts. Once you're familiar with the basics, return here for practical, ready-to-use implementations.
</Info>

<Tip title="Prerequisite">
These recipes use the OpenAI model provider by default. Ensure your OpenAI model provider has been set up using the Data Designer CLI before running a recipe.
