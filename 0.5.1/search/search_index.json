Training these agents requires trajectory data capturing the full multi-turn interaction between a model and its tools: every search, every document opened, every dead end explored.</p> <p>OpenResearcher demonstrated something worth paying attention to: synthetic trajectories generated against a local retriever (BM25 over a static corpus, no web APIs) are sufficient to train Nemotron Nano 3 to outperform GPT-4.1 on deep research benchmarks. The data format (complete tool-use traces showing how a model moves through an information space) matters more than model scale. Nemotron Nano 3, with only 3B active parameters, beats models orders of magnitude larger on multi-hop research tasks.</p> <p>This post shows how to generate that same kind of training data using Data Designer's MCP tool-use capabilities. We build a retriever as an MCP server, construct a corpus with known-good evidence, run a teacher model through the full research process, and use an LLM judge for rejection sampling.

Each question comes with annotated supporting passages, the specific paragraphs that contain the evidence needed to answer it.

Setting temperature to 1.0 with top_p at 0.95 gives enough variation that the same question can produce meaningfully different trajectories across seeds.</p> <p>The MCP tool configuration tells Data Designer which server to use and how many tool-call turns to allow:</p> <pre><code># MCP retriever tool configuration\ntool_config = dd.ToolConfig(\n    tool_alias=\"knowledge-base\",\n    providers=[\"corpus-retriever\"],\n    max_tool_call_turns=150,\n)\nconfig.add_tool_config(tool_config)\n</code></pre> <p>We set <code>max_tool_call_turns</code> high (150) because deep research trajectories can be long. Our longest observed trajectory used 25 tool calls across 53 messages. Capping too low would truncate the most interesting research chains.</p> <p>The seed dataset contains the research questions alongside reference answers (which we'll use for rejection sampling in Step 4):</p> <pre><code>config.with_seed_dataset(\n    dd.LocalFileSeedSource(path=\"questions.jsonl\"),\n)\n\nconfig.add_column(\n    dd.ExpressionColumnConfig(\n        name=\"research_question\",\n        expr=\"{{ question }}\",\n    )\n)\n</code></pre> <p>The core of the pipeline is the research column, where the teacher model receives a question and a system prompt instructing it to use the retriever tools:</p> <pre><code>SYSTEM_PROMPT = \"\"\"You are a thorough research assistant.

This is the training data: the full trajectory of how the model moved through the information space. <code>extract_reasoning_content=True</code> pulls out the model's internal chain-of-thought separately, so you can include or exclude it depending on your training setup.</p>"},{"location":"devnotes/deep-research-trajectories-with-nemo-data-designer-and-mcp-tool-use/#step-4-rejection-sampling-with-an-llm-judge","title":"Step 4: Rejection Sampling with an LLM Judge","text":"<p>Not every trajectory leads to a correct answer. OpenResearcher's approach is straightforward. Generate multiple trajectories per question, score them for correctness, and keep only the ones that got the right answer.

Using a smaller model as judge is deliberate. We don't need the judge to reason about the question, just to compare two answers for factual agreement. This keeps costs down when scoring thousands of trajectories.</p> <p>In practice, you'd generate multiple trajectories per question (varying the random seed) and filter to <code>correctness.correct == 1</code>.

In practice, getting multi-turn tool calling to work reliably with open-weight models served through vLLM turned out to be the hardest part of this project.</p> <p>We tested two open-weight models on a self-hosted vLLM (v0.15.1) instance: GPT-OSS-120B and Kimi K2.5. Both failed to produce usable research trajectories, for related but distinct reasons.</p> <p>GPT-OSS-120B uses a \"Harmony\" output format that routes text through named channels (reasoning, final answer, tool calls). When tools are involved, vLLM's parser consistently routes the model's output to the wrong channel: everything lands in <code>reasoning_content</code> while the <code>content</code> field stays empty. This happens at all <code>reasoning_effort</code> levels. The model does the research (calls tools, reads documents, formulates queries) but the final synthesized answer never appears where the serving layer expects it. This is a known issue in vLLM's Harmony format handling. Here's the final message from a typical trajectory. The model has been researching for 5 tool calls but produces no answer:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"role\": \"assistant\",\n  \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\"}],\n  \"reasoning_content\": \"It seems that the knowledge base may have a page about\n    Colin Bateman that includes his biography. Possibly the 'md_001100' entry is\n    about a footballer, not the author. The author Colin Bateman likely ...\",\n  \"tool_calls\": null\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The model's reasoning shows it has the answer (it identified Colin Bateman as the author), but the content field is empty and no tool call is emitted. The trajectory ends here with nothing to show for it.</p> <p>Kimi K2.5 exhibits a different failure mode. With its thinking mode enabled, it has the same channel-routing problem as GPT-OSS. With thinking mode disabled, the model produces content text, but after the first tool result, it narrates what it plans to do next rather than emitting another tool call. The serving layer sees text content without tool calls and treats it as the final answer, terminating the research loop after a single search:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"role\": \"assistant\",\n  \"content\": \"I found that 'Cycle of Violence' was written by Colin Bateman,\n    described as a 'Northern Irish author'. Now let me search for more details\n    about his birthplace to confirm his birth country.\",\n  \"reasoning_content\": \"The search results clearly show that 'Cycle of Violence'\n    was written by Colin Bateman, a Northern Irish author...\",\n  \"tool_calls\": null\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The model intends to keep researching (\"let me search for more details\") but describes the action instead of calling the tool. The framework sees content, no tool calls, and stops. We tried multiple tokenizer modes, prompt variations, and vLLM configurations; open issues on the model's HuggingFace page confirm this is a broader compatibility gap.</p> <p>The original OpenResearcher codebase handles this by bypassing vLLM's tool call parser entirely. They hit the raw <code>/completions</code> endpoint (<code>openai_generator.py</code>), parse <code>&lt;tool_call&gt;</code> XML tags from the output with regex, and continue looping until the model emits an explicit answer marker like <code>&lt;answer&gt;</code> or <code>final answer:</code> (<code>deploy_agent.py</code>).</p> <p>The open-source tool-calling stack is growing and maturing quickly, but multi-turn tool use with reasoning models is still a rough edge. For now, the practical path is to use models with battle-tested tool-calling support through their native APIs, which is what we do in the results below.</p>"},{"location":"devnotes/deep-research-trajectories-with-nemo-data-designer-and-mcp-tool-use/#results","title":"Results","text":"<p>We ran 64 questions uniformly sampled across 2, 3, and 4-hop difficulty levels from MuSiQue, with 50K FineWeb web documents as distractors (a 1:100 golden-to-distractor ratio).

In this post, we walk through the design principles behind NeMo Data Designer and explain why we built it as a composable orchestration framework - treating SDG as a system of specialized stages rather than a monolithic generation task.</p> <p></p> <p>When people first encounter synthetic data generation, the instinct is natural: write a detailed prompt, call a powerful LLM, and collect the output. For quick experiments and small datasets, this works fine. But as you push toward production-quality data at scale - millions of records, multiple interrelated fields, strict quality requirements - the cracks start to show. We built Data Designer around the conviction that SDG is fundamentally a systems problem, and the framework's architecture reflects that belief at every level.</p> <p>This post isn't about a specific dataset or benchmark result. Instead, we want to pull back the curtain on the design principles that shaped Data Designer itself, and share the reasoning behind the decisions we made.</p>"},{"location":"devnotes/designing-data-designer-why-sdg-is-a-systems-problem/#a-prompt-is-not-all-you-need","title":"A Prompt Is Not All You Need","text":"<p>The most common approach to synthetic data generation looks something like this: pack everything you need into one prompt - the schema, the constraints, the style guidelines, the quality criteria - and send it to the biggest model you have access to. Crank up <code>max_tokens</code>, parse the output, and repeat.</p> <p>This approach has a ceiling, and you hit it faster than you'd expect.</p> <p>Quality degrades when you overload a single call. Asking one model to simultaneously generate content, maintain diversity across a dataset, follow a complex schema, and self-assess quality is asking it to solve several distinct problems at once. The model has to allocate its \"attention budget\" across all of these competing objectives, and something always gives. Usually it's the subtler requirements - diversity narrows, edge cases get dropped, and the data starts looking suspiciously uniform.</p> <p>Prompts become unmaintainable. As requirements grow, the prompt balloons. What started as a clean paragraph becomes a multi-page document with nested instructions, conditional logic described in natural language, and examples that compete for context window space. At this point, iterating on one aspect of generation (say, adjusting the complexity distribution or tweaking the output schema) means editing a fragile mega-prompt and hoping nothing else breaks.</p> <p>There are no quality gates. In a single-call setup, validation happens after you've already spent the compute. If 30% of your records are malformed or low-quality, you find out at the end and either filter them out (wasting the tokens) or re-generate (wasting even more). There's no mechanism to catch problems between stages, because there are no stages.</p> <p>Scaling is limited. A single model call is a single point of failure. You can parallelize across records, but you can't parallelize across stages of generation, and you can't route different parts of the task to models that are better suited for them.</p> <p>None of these are problems with LLMs themselves - they're problems with treating SDG as a single-step task. The fix isn't a better model. It's a better architecture.</p>"},{"location":"devnotes/designing-data-designer-why-sdg-is-a-systems-problem/#sdg-as-a-system-of-specialized-stages","title":"SDG as a System of Specialized Stages","text":"<p>The shift in thinking is straightforward: instead of asking one model to do everything, decompose the generation task into a pipeline of focused stages, each responsible for one well-defined job.</p> <p>Regardless of what you're generating - QA pairs for retrieval training, reasoning traces for pretraining, multi-turn conversations for alignment, product reviews for testing, or labeled examples for classification - a well-decomposed SDG pipeline typically has four kinds of stages:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Seed curation. Control what goes in. Whether you're sampling from an existing corpus, selecting subsets of your data, or generating realistic persona profiles with demographic and personality attributes, the seed data defines the distribution your synthetic data will cover. This is where you control diversity and domain coverage - before any LLM is involved - so that downstream generation stages inherit that diversity naturally through their prompts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Staged generation. Each generation step has a focused job. One stage might extract structured metadata from a document. Another might generate content grounded in that metadata. A third might transform or enrich that content further. Because each stage has a narrow scope, its prompt is simple, its output is predictable, and it's easy to iterate on independently.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dependency management. Later stages build on earlier outputs. A content generation stage needs access to extracted metadata. A formatting stage needs the generated content. These dependencies form a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and the system needs to resolve that graph automatically - so you can focus on defining the stages, not orchestrating them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Quality control. Validation and scoring aren't afterthoughts - they're explicit stages in the pipeline. An LLM judge can evaluate the output of a generation stage and a validator can check structural constraints. Because these run as part of the generation pipeline, you can identify quality issues early and make informed decisions about which records to keep before investing in further downstream processing.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This decomposition buys you something that a single prompt never can: the ability to reason about, test, and improve each stage independently.</p>"},{"location":"devnotes/designing-data-designer-why-sdg-is-a-systems-problem/#design-principles-behind-data-designer","title":"Design Principles Behind Data Designer","text":"<p>With that framing in mind, here are the principles that guided Data Designer's architecture.</p>"},{"location":"devnotes/designing-data-designer-why-sdg-is-a-systems-problem/#declarative-over-imperative","title":"Declarative over imperative","text":"<p>When you define a Data Designer workflow, you describe the structure of the dataset you want - not the execution plan for how to generate it.

We wanted the configuration to read like a description of the desired output, not a script full of API calls and error handling.

When one column's prompt includes <code>{{ document_artifacts }}</code>, the framework knows that column depends on the <code>document_artifacts</code> column and must run after it. These references are automatically extracted to build a dependency graph, and the framework topologically sorts the graph to determine execution order. You don't write orchestration code - you just write columns, and the DAG emerges from the references between them.</p> <p>This composability is what makes it possible to go from a simple two-column workflow to a complex multi-stage pipeline without changing the underlying execution model.</p>"},{"location":"devnotes/designing-data-designer-why-sdg-is-a-systems-problem/#multi-model-by-design","title":"Multi-model by design","text":"<p>Not every stage in a pipeline needs the same model.

Each column can specify its own model alias, and the framework manages model routing, per-model parallelism limits, and usage tracking independently.

We wanted to show the model examples of reasoning through difficult scientific problems, and we wanted to make sure that those problems covered as wide a range of scientific domains as possible. Using seed passages from web text was an obvious choice, because it allowed us to use the seed data to control both quality and diversity.</p> <p>We started with Essential-Web, a Common Crawl (web text) dataset where each document has been labelled with respect to both quality and subject. For instance, documents are labelled with an estimated Education Level, where Graduate Level indicates that the text \u201crequires graduate-level education or domain expertise. Assumes deep background knowledge and specialized training to comprehend\u201d. These labels let us rapidly filter down the documents to the highest-quality seeds for our scientific reasoning dataset.</p> <p>Starting from the STEM subset of Essential-Web, we filtered to documents that were:</p> <ol> <li>Undergraduate-to-graduate education level</li> <li>Advanced reasoning depth</li> <li>High technical correctness</li> <li>Advanced Bloom taxonomy levels for both cognitive processes (Analyze, Evaluate or Create) and knowledge domains (Conceptual, Procedural or Metacognitive)</li> <li>In the English language and over 1000 characters.</li> </ol> <p>The resulting subset consisted of roughly 14 million documents, mostly academic. Since many of the documents were very long, we extracted random chunks of \\&lt;4096 characters in length.</p> <p>Essential-AI also labelled the documents according to the Free Decimal Correspondence (FDC) code, a public-domain analogue of the Dewey Decimal system. Using the FDC code, we could see that the topics weren\u2019t equally balanced across scientific domains; for instance, Medicine &amp; Health was heavily over-represented. Since we planned to generate \\&lt;14 million samples in total, we aimed to capture as broad a range of topics as possible in the subset of seeds we used.</p> <p>To arrive at a smaller set of seed documents balanced by topic, we used a hierarchical round-robin approach. First, we rotated between selecting seed documents across 8 major domains (Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering, Math, Medicine/Health, Physics, and Other). Within each high-level domain, we further rotated between seed documents based on their 3-digit FDC codes; for instance, given a Physics sample with code 535 (Light), the next Physics sample might be from code 536 (Heat), then 537 (Electricity) and so on, ensuring that no single subdomain dominates. We continued the round robin selection at the first and second decimal place of the FDC code, where they existed.</p> <p>We tested approaches using both the first 4.5 million and the first 9 million seeds according to the round-robin approach described above.</p>"},{"location":"devnotes/graduate-level-science-reasoning-data-with-nemo-data-designer/#step-2-generating-challenging-questions","title":"Step 2: Generating Challenging Questions","text":"<p>With our seed documents ready, we moved to NeMo Data Designer to design the actual dataset.
